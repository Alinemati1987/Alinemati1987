I have had the opportunity of being involved in several educations and job positions in my life. They made me a person with a proven track record in learning new skills. Also, I have learned how to connect my experiences and skills with each other and use this connection in new challenges. 

A couple of months ago, I decided to dive into the world of programming and started to learn coding at <a href="https://codaisseur.com/">Codaisseur Academy</a> in Amsterdam. After 9-week of intensive course, I can proudly introduce myself as a junior web-developer.

Now, I am seeking new opportunities to further enhance the best of my performance.
