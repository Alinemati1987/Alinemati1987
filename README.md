I have had the opportunity of being involved in several educations and job positions in my life. They made me a person with a proven track record in learning new skills. Also, I have learned how to connect my expriences and skils with each other and use this connection in new challenges. 

Couple of month ago, I decided to dive into the the world of programming and started to learn coding in Codaisseur Academy in Amsterdam. After 9 weeks intensive course, I can proudly introduce myself as a junior web-develope.

Now, I am seeking new opportunities to further enhance the best of my performance.
